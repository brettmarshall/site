<p>Sprites have been around for awhile now, so most likely at some point in time, you’ve created or worked with sprites. There are a couple different ways to create sprites nowadays, you can use SCSS to automatically creates sprites, you can use a user interface or you can do it the old-school way using Photoshop. I started creating sprites the old fashion way, using Photoshop, as probably most people have. That&#8217;s hard and tedious. In terms of using SCSS to automate the process, I really haven&#8217;t looked into it too much. Its kind of intimidating, based on looking at the documentation and seems somewhat limited.</p>

<p>I come from a graphic design background, so anytime I can use something visual, that&#8217;s my preference. So I went hunting for tools, and came across <a href="http://wearekiss.com/spritepad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SpritePad</a>. </p>

<p>This tool makes it extremely simple to create sprites. You just drag and drop your images on the canvas, and it creates the CSS for you in the right sidebar using the file name as the class. Once placed, you can keep dragging and dropping graphics until you are satisfied, then save and download a zip file. The zip contains a sprites.png and a CSS file.</p>

<blockquote>I started creating sprites the old fashion way, using Photoshop, as probably most people have. That's hard and tedious.</blockquote>

<p>So, we’re pretty set. We have a PNG and CSS file, with the ability to go back later and make additional changes. Now, how about we reduce the size of that PNG by about 50-70%. Check out <a href="https://tinypng.com/ " rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TinyPng</a>, I use this on a regular basis and it shrinks PNGs smaller than Photoshop, without a reduction in quality.</p>

<p>Now, there is one catch, once you run it through TinyPng, you can’t open it in Photoshop. It saves it in a format the Photoshop can’t understand, but works in every browser, so don’t worry about that. I suggest keeping a “full res” copy and a “TinyPng” copy, just in case.</p>

<p>So there is one remaining question, what about retina images? That’s a good question. I’ve looked into this a bit, but not extensively. In theory, you could export 2x images and use them when creating the sprite.  Then just shrink it by 50% in Photoshop, before optimizing with TinyPng. I’ve been a bit hesitant to use responsive sprites, only because of how background images work.When you shrink the containing element with a background image, there’s strong possibility that you’ll cut off the intended image, or make other images visible if expanded too much.</p>

<p>What do you use for sprites and image compression?</p>
