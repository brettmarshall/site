<p>Having the right tools at your disposal can be the difference between an efficient developer or an inefficient developer. I think we all start out pretty inefficient. But over the last couple of years, I have really tried to experiment and see what gives me the best workflow. I’ve compiled a list of my tools, for my home computer ( mac ), and my office computer ( pc ).</p>

<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Almost every project I do is a <a href="http://wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WordPress</a> project, both at home and at work. Since I work with WordPress everyday I’ve become really comfortable with it, allowing me to build things faster instead of learning while building. We also build eCommerce sites, for those, we use <a href="http://magento.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Magento</a>. It’s bulky, has a million files and doesn’t have great documentation. On the plus side, its incredibly powerful and open source.</p>

<h3>WordPress Plugins</h3>
<p>There are two plugins that I use on every project, <a href="http://advancedcustomfields.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Advanced Custom Fields</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-content-type-manager/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Custom Content Type Manager</a>. These two plugins allow me to create awesome backend experiences for creating / updating content. They also provide easy ways to query the data, this makes building dynamic content incredibly easy.</p>

<h3>CSS / PreProcessors</h3>
<p>OK, so I use both <a href="http://less.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LESS</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SCSS</a>. At work, I use LESS. We decided on LESS because it was most like CSS. I had some trouble getting us to adopt preprocessors, so I was satisfied with LESS. At home however, I use SCSS. For me, the edge goes to SCSS because of <a href="http://compass-style.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Compass’</a> CSS3 mixins. There is one constant between work and home, the GUI I use to manage the preprocessing. I started out using free solutions like WinLess and LessApp. But those were missing some features and we’re totally polished. From there, I moved to CodeKit. This worked for home use, but their wasn’t a PC version. So, I kept looking and stumbled upon <a href="http://mixture.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mixture.io</a>. It works as a preprocessor of images, CSS and JS files, allowing for magnification and concatenation simultaneously. This really helps for keeping files sizes down and the number of http requests. It also spins up a local server from any location on your computer. They even give you a unique url for this server that you can visit with mobile devices. This allows you to have your 4-5 devices running the website at the same time, while styling with CSS injections, pretty awesome. Mixture also is a static site generator as well, in fact this website is built using Mixture.</p>

<h3>Local Development</h3>
<p>This is is pretty standard, for work I use <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WAMP</a> and for home I use <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MAMP</a>. These are pretty much the same, especially if you mostly deal with phpMyAdmin. The only real difference is the directory where you put your files.</p>

<h3>Version Control</h3>
<p>At work and at home I use version control. At work, we use <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mercurial</a> as our VC system, <a href="https://bitbucket.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BitBucket</a> to host the files, and <a href="http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TortoiseHg</a> and the GUI. At home, I use <a href="http://git-scm.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Git</a> as my VC system, BitBucket / <a href="http://github.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to host the files, and <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SourceTree</a> / <a href="http://mac.github.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub app</a> as my GUI. Both workflows work fairly well. Github is cool for the social aspect, and that you can host static websites from Github Pages. But, if you want a private repo for free, I’d check out BitBucket.</p>

<h3>FTP</h3>
<p>I use free solutions at work and home, when it comes to FTP clients. At home, I use <a href="http://cyberduck.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CyberDuck</a> / <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FileZilla</a>. At work, I use FileZilla. Both work well, I think FileZilla is a bit more comprehensive though.</p>

<p>What are some of the tools you use?</p>
